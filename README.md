# Food Delivery Operational Analysis

## Overview
This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a food delivery dataset to understand customer behavior, service performance, and operational trends.

## Business Objective
Analyze patterns in delivery time, customer ratings, and cuisine demand to generate data-driven operational insights.

## Tools Used
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Analysis Highlights
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Distribution and trend analysis
- Delivery time and rating evaluation
- Weekday vs weekend demand comparison

## Key Insights
- Higher demand observed during weekends.
- A significant percentage of orders remain unrated.
- Delivery time variability suggests potential operational bottlenecks.

## Recommendations
- Improve customer feedback collection strategies.
- Optimize resource allocation during peak demand periods.
- Investigate factors contributing to longer delivery times.

## Engineering Perspective
Analysis performed with focus on operational performance, system behavior patterns, and data-driven decision making.
